DuckDuckGo is a private internet browser with both mobile and desktop apps. By default, it blocks all forms of online tracking and doesn't upload your search history to anyone's servers. If you're still concerned about your privacy, you can clear all your tabs and data by tapping the flame icon in the main menu.

One particular feature that privacy-conscious folks will appreciate is the security rating that appears next to the current website's address at the top of the screen. Sites are rated from D to A on their encryption levels and the number of trackers detected. Tapping on this rating opens a full-screen report card, which features an impressive amount of information on how they reached the score.

The browser has light and dark themes and a lock setting that requires Touch ID, Face ID, or passcode to use the app.

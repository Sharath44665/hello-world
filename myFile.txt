Mozilla's Firefox is one of the most popular alternatives to Chrome, Edge, and Safari browsers in part because it's been around since 2002, but mostly because of its frequent updates.

The Firefox internet browser updates regularly with bug fixes, speed improvements, security enhancements, and new features. However, these updates can be frustrating when they automatically start installing when you open the app. Then you have to wait several minutes for the new version to download and install.

Firefox is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android and lets you sync your data between each version through the use of a free Firefox account. The Android, Linux, Mac, and Windows versions of the Firefox browser support a vast library of extensions. The Windows version also supports Windows Hello authentication for enhanced security on compatible websites

You can access and write data in repositories on GitHub.com using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine. For more information, see "About SSH."

When you generate an SSH key, you can add a passphrase to further secure the key. Whenever you use the key, you must enter the passphrase. If your key has a passphrase and you don't want to enter the passphrase every time you use the key, you can add your key to the SSH agent. The SSH agent manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase.

If you don't already have an SSH key, you must generate a new SSH key to use for authentication. If you're unsure whether you already have an SSH key, you can check for existing keys. For more information, see "Checking for existing SSH keys."

If you want to use a hardware security key to authenticate to GitHub, you must generate a new SSH key for your hardware security key. You must connect your hardware security key to your computer when you authenticate with the key pair. For more information, see the OpenSSH 8.2 release notes.

DuckDuckGo is a private internet browser with both mobile and desktop apps. By default, it blocks all forms of online tracking and doesn't upload your search history to anyone's servers. If you're still concerned about your privacy, you can clear all your tabs and data by tapping the flame icon in the main menu.

One particular feature that privacy-conscious folks will appreciate is the security rating that appears next to the current website's address at the top of the screen. Sites are rated from D to A on their encryption levels and the number of trackers detected. Tapping on this rating opens a full-screen report card, which features an impressive amount of information on how they reached the score.

The browser has light and dark themes and a lock setting that requires Touch ID, Face ID, or passcode to use the app.
